# python-assignment-2-timer-
A countdown timer is a program that counts down from a specified amount of time to zero. A timer is similar, but instead of counting down to zero, it counts up from zero to a specified amount of time. In Python, you can use the time module to implement both countdowns and timers. You can also use the tkinter module to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for your project.
